              Hey, I'm Lokesh, and I'm from the Indian city of Vijayawada. In
              sixth grade, I had my first encounter with a computer, and it
              marked the beginning of my aspiration to pursue a career in the
              field of computing. Subsequently, I am pursuing a B.Tech degree in
              Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and have immersed myself in
              the world of programming. <br />
              <br />
              I've dedicated countless days and nights to mastering Data
              Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, though I believe
              continuous practice is essential for improvement. <br />
              <br />
              My journey expanded into web development, where I dived into HTML
              and CSS. Then, I encountered the challenging subject of
              JavaScript, which, despite its difficulties 🥲, I managed to grasp
              the fundamentals. Fortunately, I embarked on the path of using the
              React Library to craft web and native UI experiences. <br />
              <br />
              Finally, given the opportunity, I would like to use all of my
              skill sets and knowledge to design, code, and debug some
              impressive projects.
